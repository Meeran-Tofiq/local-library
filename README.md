This project was made for The Odin Porject, and MDN Express tutorials. It is a library system in a web page with a dedicated database using MongoDB.
You can add, remove, update, or view any author, genre, book, book copy (instance) you want.

# Skills displayed

-   Using Express to evelop a fully functional backend.
-   Using MongoDB to setup a database that will hold all necessary data.
-   PUG templating tool to create html that will be filled out with data retrieved from the DB.
-   Creating models for the database to structure the data that will enter the DB.
-   Form validation and sanitation to ensure consistency, and security.

# Deployment

You can click [this](https://local-library-meran.adaptable.app) link to visit the webpage on an Adaptable deployment.

However, it is important to note, that it may not always work. This is because I am using the free version of both Adaptable and MongoDB. And
it is possible that the page has reached it's limit of API calls.
